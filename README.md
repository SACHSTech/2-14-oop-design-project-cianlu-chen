## Summary
The real-whole system modelled in this design is an online shopping page. Users will be able to create shopping carts that they will be able to add products into. Other functions include checking what products are already added, removing a product, and checking out. Products are split into two categories: food and clothes. 

Once a cart is checked out, users can view the total number of sales and revenue of the store.
